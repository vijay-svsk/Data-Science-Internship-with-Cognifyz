# Internship Project Repository

Welcome to the internship project repository! This repository contains code and resources for three distinct projects:

## 1. MNIST_PROJECT
The MNIST_PROJECT is dedicated to dataset preprocessing. It involves handling the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digits widely used for training various image processing systems.

## 2. STOCK_PREDICTION_PROJECT
The STOCK_PREDICTION_PROJECT focuses on stock price prediction based on collected datasets. It utilizes machine learning and statistical models to predict stock prices, providing insights for investors and traders.

## 3. Titanic_Prediction_project
The Titanic_Prediction_project involves data analysis and prediction tasks using the Titanic dataset. This project explores the dataset, performs data analysis, and predicts survival outcomes based on various features using machine learning algorithms.

## MNIST_PROJECT
The MNIST_PROJECT directory contains code and resources for preprocessing the MNIST dataset. It involves tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction to prepare the dataset for machine learning models.

## STOCK_PREDICTION_PROJECT
The STOCK_PREDICTION_PROJECT directory includes code and resources for predicting stock prices. It utilizes historical stock data, applies machine learning algorithms, and evaluates model performance to predict future stock prices.

## Titanic_Prediction_project
The Titanic_Prediction_project directory contains code and resources for analyzing the Titanic dataset. It explores passenger demographics, survival rates, and other features to predict survival outcomes using machine learning techniques.

## How to Use
- Navigate to each project directory to access the respective code and resources.
- Follow the README.md files within each project directory for detailed instructions on running and using the code.
- Make sure to install any necessary dependencies specified in the README files before running the code.

Feel free to explore and contribute to these projects! Each project provides valuable insights into different aspects of data preprocessing, analysis, and prediction tasks.
